THE LORD OF TERROR MUSIC PACK
Assembled by Tolitz Rosel (tolitzrosel@gmail.com)

DESCRIPTION:
This is the music pack for The Lord of Terror - Diablo Campaign module.  I put this here as a separate download because of its size, and the current size of the module itself (splitting it up would make it more manageable - if not easier - for dial-up users).

This collection features the modified scores of John Williams, James Horner, Pino Donaggio, Mark Snow, John Ottman, Bill Conti, Christopher Fields, and of course, the premier Diablo music composer Matt Uelman.  It also features some Vault musical contributions from Justin R. Durban (Egden), Eon Blue, Balaghan [Koghal2K], Gimperion, Josh Siefried, TheForge,  etc. 


INSTRUCTIONS:
